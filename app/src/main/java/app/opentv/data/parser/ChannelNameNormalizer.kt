/**
 * Turns the channel names IPTV providers actually ship into something usable.
 *
 * A real provider list contains entries like:
 *
 *     UK| BBC ONE FHD
 *     UK - BBC One HD
 *     [UK] BBC 1 ᵁᴴᴰ
 *     ### PRIME RAW 60fps ####
 *
 * while an XMLTV guide calls the same channel `BBC One`. Nothing in either format joins
 * them. This normaliser produces, for any name:
 *
 *  - a **base name** with country prefixes, quality tags and decorations stripped
 *  - a **group key** (lowercased alphanumerics of the base) used to fold quality variants
 *    of one channel into a single row, and to match against guide data
 *  - a **quality rank and label**, so the app can pick the best variant by default and
 *    offer the rest as a switch during playback
 *
 * This one object is the foundation of both headline features: EPG matching and quality
 * grouping. It is pure and heavily tested — when a channel matches the wrong guide entry,
 * the fix almost certainly starts here, in a test case named after the offending channel.
