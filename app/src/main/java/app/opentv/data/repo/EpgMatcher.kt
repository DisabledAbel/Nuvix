/**
 * Joins provider channels to guide channels when nobody gave us a join key.
 *
 * The provider says `UK| BBC ONE FHD`. The guide says `BBC One` (id `bbc1.uk`). The only
 * bridge between them is the name, so both sides are pushed through
 * [ChannelNameNormalizer.groupKeyOf] and matched on the result.
 *
 * ## The design rule: prefer no match to a wrong match
 *
 * A missing guide entry reads as "provider doesn't do EPG" and can be fixed with a manual
 * override. A *wrong* one shows EastEnders against a sports channel, and the user reasonably
 * concludes the whole guide is broken. So the fuzzy tier only accepts a prefix match when it
 * is **unambiguous** — exactly one guide channel fits. `bbcone` will claim `BBC One` when
 * that is the only candidate, but if the guide carries `BBC One London` *and* `BBC One
 * Wales` and nothing plain, we refuse to guess between regions.
